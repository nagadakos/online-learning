class MyClass(Dataset):
	''' Description This class defines the skeleton of transforming a folder containging
		raw data csv files, to PyTorch datasets, redy to feed to Dataloaders. This class
		also takes care of reshaping raw data to desired format of the models. It
		also should provide a way to check data loading ranges, for their validity
		and internally be aware of the files it can read data from.
	
		Usage:	To use data with this class, one must:
				1) Define how items are return in getitem
				2) Define create_shaped data function. A lot of this code is reusable
				3) Provide the algorithm with which the data is to be reshaped, in
				   shape_data_function
				4) Change how raw data is loaded in load() function
				5) Define bound validity. Each dataset has some quirks
				6) Provide a proper string description of the data in get_descr (Optional)
